## Story Mode

-   Players go through a story mode with three levels and a final boss at the end. These levels consist of physics engines which involve raycasting, collisions, as well as the use of hitboxes and projectiles.

-   Player HUD: The top left corner displays character information such as their health and number of lives. The top right corner displays the number of coins collected throughout the level.

-   Player: The player is controlled with keybindings and collides with platforms, enemies, and projectiles. When hit, the player receives damage and moves accordingly. When health reaches zero or player falls off the map, the player respawns after three seconds. Player respawns at nearest checkpoint.

-   Enemies: There are many enemy variants including a boss. The enemies patrol a specific area and avoid falling off of platforms through raycasting. However, the enemies also have a detection radius if a player gets too close, triggering them to pursue the player. That said, the enemies are somewhat intelligent.

-   Buttons: Book Icon used to view controls. Restart Icon used to reset the scene and start the game again from scratch. Home button allows player to return to Menu. Settings Icon used to adjust volume or mute sounds.
